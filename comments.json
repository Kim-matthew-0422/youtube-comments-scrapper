    "text": "If Samsung strategize by advertising their phones to at least 2 popular TV channels in every country, penetrate the media strongly, give their products to popular YouTubers, TikTokers ,Bollywood and Nollywood celebraties. People will notice they are using a Galaxy and you know everything celebraties use are always the best to the viewers so they&#39;ll want to get it. Samsung should not relax because Samsung is not apple .These are 2 different companies, apple&#39;s  home country is the US which leads the world and has the most popular stars, all of them using iphones .Rather Samsung should focus very strong in the whole world especially in Africa and Asia which are growing in population . My messages to Samsung is that they should strategize because there are huge problems awaiting them in the future. We have Oppo which only in this 2023 the brand has gotten so popular in my country due to color OS beauty and their phone design, this brand might be a big problem to Samsung in the future . We have Xiaomi though their growth is steady . We have apple which is the biggest problem Samsung is dealing with. We have vivo, realme and honor. We have the worst problem in the future of Samsung that is Huawei, Huawei is growing so fast again and it&#39;s name just make me get tempted and others too to get it even without gms and 5g ,but this brand should be the second best selling brand in my country after Samsung and it might even outdo Samsung. So Samsung do something before it&#39;s too late"
