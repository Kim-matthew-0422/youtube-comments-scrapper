I love the display and size of it.... took me a bit to get used to android after a few years of using IOS.. but overall iv had it for 2 months and it still feels like I just got it ♥"

    "text": "I have the 12 pro max and 14 pro max and a couple of older galaxys , looking at the differences between the 12 and 14 models  ,in general day to day use and general performance , i find much as you have shown here Nick , my old 12 pro max still performs like a beauty , and in my own speed test tests between the two , the difference more often than not for general use was imo very small , and i usually have 4 phones a macbook and ipad at my side , and when it comes to the iphones , im just as happy to pick up the 12 pro max as the newer 14 pro max , and i still prefer the notch to the island ..... just personal preference , but i do always carry the 14 whne i go somewhere , and when outside in the sun or in bright day light , the slightly more bright screen of the 14 pro max is a bit of a luxury  on the eyes , although the 12 was still quite decent .<br>  Given i dont game on phones , and really dont run them at the limit , i probably could have saved some coin and just stayed with the  old fathful 12 PM  ...... but wheres the fun in that :) ."
