But since I&#39;m offered a trade in value of $1250 AUD, same as new one on sale I&#39;ll upgrade for the heck of it. I think if your the type who males use of all the extras and is fanatical about how you use your phone then it&#39;s worth it. General users don&#39;t bother unless you need it. üòå  <br><br>I&#39;ve had the whole range of S series and Note series and I still liked my Huwai mate 20 pro more. It&#39;s more indestructible when it comes to damage and durability. <br><br>Every samsung I&#39;ve always shattered the screens. HTC used make durable and exceptional phones but don&#39;t know what happened to them <br><br>How Does this s23 ultra compare for gaming than the s22 ultra?"

    "text": "If you are more into mobile videography, go for s23 Ultra. But if you are more into photography, s22 Ultra pictures including night mode pictures are much better than s23 Ultra. I own s22 Ultra and recently got s23 Ultra too. After doing image and video comparison, I found s22 Ultra images are less grainy, sharper (less sharp after April update), more clear, basically overall better than s23 Ultra. But in s23 Ultra colours are more accurate, especially skin tones, sky colours, reds are very close to natural colour. The videos are definitely better than s22 Ultra. Surprisingly, shadow areas are grainier in pictures, but video of the same shadow areas has no grains in s23 Ultra. And obviously no grains in s22 Ultra. After April update, selfie video quality has improved a lot in s22 Ultra. So, overall s22 Ultra is more stable in terms of camera performance. Upgrading to s23 Ultra from s22 Ultra is a waste of money unless you are more into mobile videography than photography."

I generally rate this guy but there are a lot a variables. If he has two phones in his pockets and use both or if he uses only the FHD and 60hz settings, yes I can see why he gets more battery life. Disappointed about the wishy washy style of explaining features like battery life without explaining constraints or references so its a more analytical approach to testing said features."
